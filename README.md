# recycle
retrofuturistic way to throw files into a trash can

## usage example

  » touch `jot 5`
  » ls
  1  2  3  4  5
  » recycle 1 2 3
  » ls
  4  5

and now files 1 2 and 3 are safely in ~/.Trash

trashing files this way from the terminal supports "Put Back" functionality in Finder and is much safer than using rm

start recycling today ^.^
